    {
      "issue": "Duplicate Functions",
      "description": "There are duplicate functions in `password_utils.py`: `is_valid_password`, `is_password_valid`, and `is_password_strong` all perform the same check for password length.",
      "files": ["password_utils.py"],
      "suggestion": "Consolidate these functions into one clear function and remove duplicates."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Insufficient Logging",
      "description": "The `auto_feedback.py` script lacks logging functionalities, relying solely on print statements.",
      "files": ["auto_feedback.py"],
      "suggestion": "Implement proper logging using Python's `logging` module for better tracking and debugging capabilities."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Duplicate Imports",
      "description": "`ben_gui.py` has duplicate import statements for the `os` module.",
      "files": ["ben_gui.py"],
      "suggestion": "Remove duplicate import statements to clean up the code."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Potential Inefficiency",
      "description": "The function `fetch_binance_data` in `get_binance_data.py` directly writes fetched data to the CSV file after every fetch, which might be inefficient if frequently called.",
      "files": ["get_binance_data.py"],
      "suggestion": "Consider storing data in memory or batching multiple fetches before writing to reduce disk I/O operations."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Redundant Code Checking",
      "description": "Several scripts (e.g., `full_tsi_bot.py`) repeat logic for calculating TSI across different dataframes with similar code blocks.",
      "files": ["full_tsi_bot.py"],
      "suggestion": "Abstract repeated logic into individual functions to improve code reusability and readability."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Hardcoded Values",
      "description": "In `run_bot_logic.py` and other scripts, there are hardcoded file paths, API keys, and parameters.",
      "files": ["run_bot_logic.py", "config.py"],
      "suggestion": "Use configuration files or environment variables to manage these values."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Error Handling",
      "description": "In `ben_gui.py`, file operations lack error handling, which might cause crashes if a file is missing or has read/write issues.",
      "files": ["ben_gui.py"],
      "suggestion": "Implement try-except blocks around file operations to handle IO errors gracefully."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Code Organization",
      "description": "There is a lack of modular structure; files like `macro_builder.py` have too much functionality within a single class.",
      "files": ["macro_builder.py"],
      "suggestion": "Consider breaking large classes into smaller, more manageable components for easier maintenance and testing."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Performance Optimization",
      "description": "The 'render_template' function in `template_manager.py` potentially loads templates each time it's called.",
      "files": ["template_manager.py"],
      "suggestion": "Cache templates or use lazy loading if they don't change often to improve performance."
    }
